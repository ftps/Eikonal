# EIKONAL SOLVER #

C++ project I did as an intern at Aerospace Propulsion Products B.V.
Solves the Eikonal equation on a mesh geometry, used to predict its burning surface evolution.

Currently only works for 3D meshes using the GMSH API
Needs work to better implement 2D meshes, some form of visualisation (probably using GMSH post-proc), and higher order methods.
